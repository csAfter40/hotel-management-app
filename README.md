This is my final project of Harvard's CS50 Web Developement with Python and JavaScript online course. I am planning to make a hotel management web applications which can be used by front desk members, staff, managers and customers. 

In this project I have experienced:
    * using class based views,
    * creating a custom mixin,
    * organizing multiple apps in a project,
    * running a project in a virtual environment,
    * installing and using some django packages,
    * using htmx for ajax,
    * creating a custom model manager,
    * using signals
    * managing media files
    * increasing performance with select_related and prefetch_related()
    so far...

Project specifications:

Overview

The final project is your opportunity to design and implement a dynamic website of your own. So long as your final project draws upon this course’s lessons, the nature of your website will be up to you, subject to some constraints as indicated below.
Requirements

In this project, you are asked to build a web application of your own. The nature of the application is up to you, subject to a few requirements:

    Your web application must be sufficiently distinct from the other projects in this course (and, in addition, may not be based on the old CS50W Pizza project), and more complex than those.
        A project that appears to be a social network is a priori deemed by the staff to be indistinct from Project 4, and should not be submitted; it will be rejected.
        A project that appears to be an e-commerce site is strongly suspected to be indistinct from Project 2, and your README.md file should be very clear as to why it’s not. Failing that, it should not be submitted; it will be rejected.
    Your web application must utilize Django (including at least one model) on the back-end and JavaScript on the front-end.
    Your web application must be mobile-responsive.
